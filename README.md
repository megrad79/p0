# Revature - Java Reactive | Project 0 : Command Line Application
## SUMMARY: Lightning Predictor App

## Goals:
1. predict next lightning stirke given data
2. predict lightning in given area, given history trends (possibly try to get all in US based on zipcode)
3. output lightning map through time
4. output lightning heat map
>>> BONUS: Can also try predicting the magnitude + landfall + potential warnings?
